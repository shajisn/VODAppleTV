# appletv-boilerplate
A boilerplate for bootstrapping AppleTV apps using [atvjs](https://github.com/emadalam/atvjs).

### Getting Started

Assuming that you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine, do the following to get started:

```shell
$ npm install -g gulp                   # Install Gulp globally
$ npm install                           # Install dependencies
```

### Development
Builds the application and starts a webserver. By default the webserver starts at port 9001.

```shell
$ npm start
```

By default, it builds in debug mode and starts the server with live reload.

* If you need to build otherwise, use `gulp` with additional flags.
* If you need to build in release mode, add `--t production` flag.
* You can define a port with `--p 8080` flag. (If you start the server on a different port, make sure to update the same in the native application)

### Structure
The project is split into two parts:

- native: this directory contains the Xcode project and related files. The AppDelegate.swift file handles the setup of the TVMLKit framework and launching the JavaScript context to manage the application.
- web: this directory contains the JavaScript and TVML template files needed to render the application. The contents of this directory must be hosted on a server accessible from the device.
